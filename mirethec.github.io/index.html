    Welcome to my website
  </h2>
  I am Mirethec. <br> 
   I live in Slovakia. One of the smaller 
  countries with underrated culture. <br>
   My favourite food is Kebab. Why?
  Because its simple, yet so good. <br>
   I like messing with computers because they go like: 
  0110100111001. <br>
   I play Arena 
  Breakout, Albion Online, Brawl stars and Asetto Corsa. 
  I enjoy driving but I don't have a drivers 
  licence so I play AC. Before that I played
  Euro Truck Simulator 2 which was about, you
  guessed it, trucks. I stopped playing it 
  because it wasn't fun anynore, but I still 
  use  to look at tuned trucks on Instagram 
  and like driving them too. <br>

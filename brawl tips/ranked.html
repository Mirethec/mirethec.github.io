     Beginner Tips
    </h2>
    1. Use all 15 seconds <div bronze-gold=""></div>
    Never select brawler impulsively.
    When you find good brawler, tap him,
    but don't select him. Try to find better
    pick. I've noticed many people (even me)
    at lower ranks just double tap brawler 
    and don't select right build  (gears, gadgets, etc.)
    so remember to not double click and select right build.

    2. Focus on banning new brawlers.
    New brawlers are often broken and hard to play 
    against with.

    3. Know when to make advantage of modifiers
    Sometimes it is  better to pick other brawler 
    ,even though it doesn't make advantage with
    modifiers, because it could for example add needed
    diversity for the teamor counter enemy picks.

    4. Learn the meta
    In my opinion the best way to learn it 
    is to watch Youtube videos about it.
    I recommend CryingMan and SpenLC.

    5. Upgrade atleast one class of every brawler to 
    power 11.
    You will have advantage. I recommend upgrading brawlers that
    you play a lot or from meta.

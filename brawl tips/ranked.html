     Beginner Tips
    </h2>
    1. Use all 15 seconds <div bronze-gold=""></div>
    Never select brawler impulsively.
    When you find good brawler, tap him,
    but don't select him. Try to find better
    pick. I've noticed many people (even me)
    at lower ranks just double tap brawler 
    and don't select right build  (gears, gadgets, etc.)
    so remember to not double click and select right build.

    2. Focus on banning new brawlers.
    New brawlers are often broken and hard to play 
    against with.

    3. Know when to make advantage of modifiers

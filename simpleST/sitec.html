SITEC is short for: SImple screen Time app made by mirethEC.
</h1>
<p>I plan to make it first for Android, then for Windows, Linux and maybe for iOS.
  <br>It will help you track your screen time and give you insights about your usage.<br>
  Its main feature will be a simple and intuitive interface in notifications <br>
   that allows users to customize it and easily monitor their screen time across different devices.
